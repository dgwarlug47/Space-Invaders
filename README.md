# Space-Invaders
my implementation of Space Invaders, a simple 2D video game, released by Taito in Japan in 1978 and the US in 1980.

Description:

The player has a spaceshipt that launches missles against the invaders.
According to each level the invaders should move faster, and as you hit an invader
or go down through a column the invaders get faster too.

Key commands:

Press left and right to make the spaceship move

Press space to launch missle

The Goal of the game is to kill all invaders
